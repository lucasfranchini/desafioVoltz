## How to run

1. Clone this repository
2. install docker and docker-compose in your machine
3. create a .env like .env.example with your mongo database values and the port that you want to run the API
4. run your API using the command:

```
make dev
```

5. Finally call http://localhost:3000/routename changing 'routename' for the route you wanna call.

obs: the env `DATABASE_URL` uses the format:

```
 mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
```

where `host` and `port` are fixed values defined in docker-compose and `username` and `password` are the same values used in the environment variables `MONGODB_USER` and `MONGODB_PASSWORD`.

`host` is the name of the docker database container (mongodb) and `port` is the internal database port used (27017)

## How to run tests

1. Clone this repository
2. install docker and docker-compose in your machine
3. don't alter the .env.test
4. run test cases using the command:

```
make test
```

obs: the env `DATABASE_URL` uses the format:

```
 mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
```

where `host` and `port` are fixed values defined in docker-compose and `username` and `password` are the same values used in the environment variables `MONGODB_USER` and `MONGODB_PASSWORD`.

`host` is the name of the docker database container (mongodb_test) and `port` is the internal database port used (27017)

## avaliable routes

- GET /tools

- `make dev` : runs the back-end in development mode using docker, watching file changes. It will show the logs in your terminal.
- `make dev-detached` : runs the back-end in development mode using docker, watching file changes. The docker container will be detached from your terminal.
- `make dev-down` : stop and remove the docker containers created with 'make dev' or 'make dev-detached'.
- `make test` : build and run the back-end in test mode using docker, run the tests file and stop and remove the containers right after the tests are finished.
